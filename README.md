Alexa skill for 1st Arborfield Scouts

Started as a project for my 9yo cub, Lara, as part of her personal challenge.

This skill is a custom alexa skill using nodeJS and will make use of the Online Scout Manager (OSM) rest API to fetch the calendar of events.  For more details about OSM please see [https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/](https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/)
